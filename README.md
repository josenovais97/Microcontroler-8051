# Microcontroler-8051

Project made for computer architecture and technology class.

1.zip -> counter from '0' to 'F' and backwards using the two buttons of the microcontroler.

2.zip -> locker based on a state machine with option of changing the enter code.

3.zip -> from the 1.zip we use termite to communicate with the microcontroler, implementation of the UART so we can increment or decrement using 'i', 'I', '+', 'd', 'D' and '-' keys of your computer.
